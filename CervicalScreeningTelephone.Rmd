## Cervical screening benefits

Regular cervical cancer screening reduces the risk of cancer incidence by approximately a factor of 3 to 4 compard to no screening (for women aged 35 to 79 years), and reduces mortality by a factor of 4 to 10. Regular cervical cancer screening reduces the risk of cervical cancer incidence and death by up to a factor of two compared to irregular cervical cancer screening[^1].

## Cervical screening outcome payment

Current eligible practice population : 813 (according to May 2017 PIP data)

Annual outcome payment : $3 per eligible patient = $2439. Never yet received

* Current cervical screening coverage rate (according to 2017 PIP data) = 66.79%
* Target Diabetes SIP claim rate to claim annual outcome payement = 70%

Potential additional Cervical SIP revenue, if target Cervical SIP claim rate achieved, assuming that half of additionally screened women can have a cervical SIP item claimed
= (70-66.79)/100 * 813 * $35 * 0.5 =  $456.7

Additional revenue if Cervical Outcome Payment achieved
= $2439 (annual outcome payment) + $456.7 (additional cervical SIP revenue)
= $2895.7
